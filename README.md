# Optimistic ERC20 Token Balance Checker

This is a modified version of [ETH Balance Checker](https://github.com/wbobeirne/eth-balance-checker) contract ready for Optimistic Ethereum added on top of the official [Optimism Tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial)

## Setting Up

We're using an Ethereum development framework called [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) to make our lives a lot easier.
If you haven't used Hardhat before, we hope you'll be pleasantly surprised!
Hardhat is well designed and full of useful features.
Go ahead and set up Hardhat by running:

```sh
yarn install
```


## How to compile

```sh
yarn compile
```

## Running the tests

```sh
yarn test
```

If everything is going as planned, you should see a bunch of green checkmarks.

## Deployments

The BalanceChecker contract has been deployed to Optimism (Kovan) at the address:
